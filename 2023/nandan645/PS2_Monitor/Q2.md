# Challenge 2 - Docker Monitoring & Scripting

This problem was no less than a headache, cuz it was 1st time I was using Docker and things were not working as expected (atleast in this case).

Writing this doc later and unfortunatly I didnt took any screenshot.

But I'll try to explain with whatever I have now.

### Prometheus and cAdvisor

So, I tried a lot of things to get the stopped container images. I tried prometheus and with it I also tried ```cAdvisor```. None of them actually helped and made things even more complicated.

I also set up the prometheus alerts but it was so slow with sending emails.

### Python Docekr Library

Python Library was also not working. Soo many internal errors.

### How I did it.

Made this simple python script to get stopped cotainers.
~~~
import os

exits = os.popen('docker ps -a --format "{{.Names}}" --filter "status=exited"')
# active = os.popen('docker ps -a --format "{{.Names}}" --filter "status=running"')

print(exits.read())
# print(active.read())
~~~

This python script will be trigerred by a shell script ```alert.sh```.

What this script will de is compare it with another file named ```firstScrape``` and if changes are found, it will fire up the mail.py file.

Mail.py will mail the content from the firstScrape file as it now contains the updated list of exited containers.

Now if I stop the running container manually and run the alert.sh script : 
![stop](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS2_Monitor/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-11%2021-05-55.png)

It will send the mail alert.

![mail](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS2_Monitor/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-11%2021-07-18.png).

Now, to automate this, we can add the script to crontab.

~~~
*/15 * * * * bash /user/Path_to_folder/alert.sh
~~~

I took this comparing code from my old repo which was used in a web scraping project and that's the reason I didnt explain the code much, but this works :)
