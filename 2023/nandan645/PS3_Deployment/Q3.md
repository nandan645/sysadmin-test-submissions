## Challenge 3 - Docker Deployments

### What I tried ...

Deploying contaier for SAIC website :- That was easy, packed everything inside httpd image.
Dockerfile :-
~~~
FROM httpd:2.4
COPY . /usr/local/apache/htdocs/
~~~

Docker commands :-
~~~
docker build -t my-apache .
docker run -dit --name saic-website -p 8080:80 my-apache2
~~~
![apache](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS3_Deployment/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-10%2003-22-59.png)

Here's the SAIC website on local host.

Next part, it was a pain. cuz that git-lang repo is 8 yrs old, seriously ?

So 1st issue I rant into was installing issue due to ruby version, so I switched to ```2.3.1``` as used in that repo.

Next problem was due to that ```config.ru``` file (tried following dockerfile from dockerhub page), so the temp solution to this - I commented it out :),

~~~
FROM ruby:2.3.1

# throw errors if Gemfile has been modified since Gemfile.lock
RUN bundle config --global frozen 1

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
RUN bundle install

COPY . .

# CMD ["./config.rb"]
~~~

Now I don't know what the heck does this site or whatever it is, is supposed to do.

Tried assigning it port 3000, loaded nothing in browser.

So finally, I deployed it normally and continued ...

~~~
docker build -t my-ruby-app .
docker run -it --name github-languages my-ruby-app
~~~

Here's docker ps

![ruby_ps](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS3_Deployment/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-10%2003-41-44.png)

### Docker compose

docker-compose.yaml

~~~
version: "3"
services:
  website:
    image: my-apache
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    restart: always

  git-lang:
    image: my-ruby-app
    restart: always
~~~

docker-compose ps

![docker-compose ps](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS3_Deployment/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-10%2004-18-30.png)

### Volume Backup

I found this github repo [Docker Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ChristianLempa/cheat-sheets/blob/main/docker/docker.md), got instructions from here to backup.

~~~
docker run --rm --volumes-from <container> -v $(pwd):/backup busybox tar cvfz /backup/backup.tar <container-path>
~~~

So for example I'll start the saic wibsite container that is my-apache and then create a backup of entire container ```/``` for keeping it simple.

![run_bkp](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS3_Deployment/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-11%2022-16-20.png)

And here's the backed up zip : ```backup.tar```

![backup](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS3_Deployment/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-11%2022-18-06.png)

And to make a backup daily at 11:55 PM, we need to add ```55 23 * * * docker run --rm --volumes-from my-apache -v $(pwd):/backup busybox tar cvfz /backup/backup.tar /``` to cron.

In place of PWD we also need to specify where we need to save our backup data or else it will store it in root dir.

##### Q. Suggest network types to use for each container and give justification for your choice of network.

I dont have much idea about it, neither my github-languages image worked properly, but accortding to my understanding, for ```SAIC-Website``` we need to have a bridged network type cuz that would be more convenient.
