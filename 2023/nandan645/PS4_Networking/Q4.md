## Challenge 4 - Docker & Networking

Saw this ```" To demonstrate and test your script(s) you must use this image (lightweight) or this one (customizable). "``` while making the documentation, and now its too late to redo everything. Anyways I checked the Image and ig using another image wont make any difference in judging my work.

### Building Image

Building a simple image with a demo website on apache.

Dockerfile : 
~~~
FROM httpd:2.4
COPY . /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
~~~

Building and deploying image :
~~~
docker build -t demo_website .
docker run -dit --name samosa_chaat -p 8080:80 demo_website
~~~

Dont ask what kind of website is this, even I don't remember why I made this. ðŸ˜‚

### Now its time for load-balancing.

So, this time I had to make some changes in the previous image, cuz the the page wont load up, My guess is it's cuz of port conflicts between apache and nginx , as default port of both of them is 80.

Here's updated Dockerfile :
~~~
FROM httpd:2.4

# Changed the default port to 8080

RUN sed -i 's/Listen 80/Listen 8080/' /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

COPY . /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
~~~

Simply putting, I created a docker-compose with httpd and nginx with some config.

Then I launched (scaled) 3 instances of same website.

~~~
sudo docker-compose up -d --build --scale demo=3
~~~
![compose_up](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS4_Networking/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-11%2003-41-54.png)

docker-compose.yml :
~~~
version: '3'

services:
  demo:
    build:
      context: demo
    ports:
      - "8080"

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
    depends_on:
      - demo
    ports:
      - "80:80"

~~~

nginx.conf :

~~~
events {
    worker_connections 1000;
}

http {
    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {

            proxy_pass http://demo:8080;
        }
    }
}
~~~

![ps](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS4_Networking/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-11%2003-43-13.png)

Now the site is accessible from port 80 and the load will be balanced.

### Design a custom log file architecture/format.

Dont have time left to do this, leaving it here.

Done !
